## Project Motivation
In this project, I wanted to understand which factors influenced whether a customer would purchase an item using an offer from Starbucks. I used a machine learning classification model to predict if a customer would use an offer successfully or not.

## File Description
data:
  - portfolio.json: dataset containing various offers and associated data
  - profile.json: dataset containing all customer records
  - transcript.json: All customer-store interactions (offers and transactions)
Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Python notebook that explores the data and builds a classification model
randomforestclassifier.pkl: Pickle file of fitted model
